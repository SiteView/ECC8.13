The response time between the SAP GUI and the dispatcher is not included in this value.    The response time does NOT include the time taken to transfer data from the R/3 frontend to the application server. For networks with low performance, this can create a highly subjective response time. The transfer time is contained in the GUI network time.    Response time is usually split into wait time plus dispatch time.    The CPU time is not an additive component of the response time, but the sum of the CPU time that is used by the individual components. The CPU time therefore provides additional, independent information on the response time.
