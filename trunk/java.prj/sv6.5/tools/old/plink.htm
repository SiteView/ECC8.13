<P>The PuTTY executables and source code are distributed under the MIT licence, 
which is similar in effect to the BSD licence. (This licence is <A

<P>The precise licence text, as given in the About box and in the file LICENCE 
in the source distribution, is as follows:

<P>In particular, anybody (even companies) can use PuTTY without restriction 
(even for commercial purposes) and owe nothing to me or anybody else. Also, 
apart from having to maintain the copyright notice and the licence text in 
derivative products, anybody (even companies) can adapt the PuTTY source code 
into their own programs and products (even commercial products) and owe nothing 
to me or anybody else. And, of course, there is no warranty and if PuTTY causes 
you damage you're on your own, so don't use it if you're unhappy with that. </P>
